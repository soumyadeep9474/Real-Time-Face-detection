# Real-Time-Face-detection
This is a real-time security camera application built on a flask server to stream video from a Raspberry Pi to the internet. Motion detection was implemented using OpenCV to issue alerts through the Twitter API when motion is detected. Face detection was also implemented to detect and save any faces found in the stream.
